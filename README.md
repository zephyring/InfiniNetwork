# Infini-Network

A network that helps each other. 

Everyone who joins the network must take a work from network's backlog, 
in exchange for joining the network. 

Each work will be rewarded with coins depending on the nature of work.

Once in the network, you can create work, assign rewards, and put into network's backlog for others to do.

While in the network, you will also have to maintain a certain active level to remain in the network, 
by doing regular daily tasks generated by the network itself. Rewards will be gained.

There're two types of work, system generated work or user defined work, in the backlog. 
System generated work is used to increase total rewarding amount of the system, as well as membership maintenance.
User defined work is anything defined by the member of the network that follow the work contract.
